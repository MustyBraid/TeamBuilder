Hello! This is a project by Casey Chartier, or Mustybraid if you prefer. My Github is located at https://github.com/MustyBraid and I can be reached by email at chartiercasey@gmail.com.

This project uses the inquirer package to take user input, and the rxjs package to make the whole thing needlessly complicated but more interesting. Eventually a full suite of tests and completed html rendering will be implemented.

I wanted to make this with rxjs to better understand asynchronous programming and evnet handling, as this was a totally new concept to me when starting my bootcamp. rxjs emulates the "observable" object that is apparently native to languages like Java, and it's really interesting! Observables can 'return' multiple values, essentially, rather than being one-and-done like vanilla Javascript onjects. 

A link to me giving a walkthrough of this early version of the project is currently hosted at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oeuKny89-4PLx0FUbpJipBK8Z4bszoRx/view
